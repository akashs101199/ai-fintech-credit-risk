# 💰 AI-Driven Credit Risk Scoring & Fraud Detection Dashboard

A robust end-to-end platform for **dynamic credit risk analytics**, **fraud detection**, and **interactive explainability**, powered by machine learning and modern data infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Credit Risk Scoring Engine
- Uses XGBoost / LightGBM for credit risk classification.
- Real-time risk prediction via FastAPI.
- Explainable output using SHAP.

### 🔐 Fraud Detection (Planned)
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forests & Autoencoders.
- Graph-based detection with NetworkX & GNNs (planned).

### 📊 Streamlit Dashboard
- Intuitive UI for non-technical users.
- Gauge chart for real-time risk level.
- SHAP-based feature impact plot.
- Risk distribution and user profile breakdowns.
- Clean, aesthetic, and easy to interpret.
